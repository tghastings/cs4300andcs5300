# Examples of Thesis and RQ Questions 
## Example 1:
**Thesis Statement**

This literature review investigates the intersection of modern methodologies, human factors, and emerging technologies within software engineering, with a focus on practical insights that can be critically analyzed within a single academic term. The goal is to equip graduate students with a structured understanding of how contemporary practices are applied, challenged, and adapted in real-world projects, while identifying research gaps that can be explored through course assignments and projects.

**Research Questions**

RQ1: How do Agile and DevOps practices affect team productivity and software quality in short-term software projects?
Scoping: Students can review empirical studies, case reports, and meta-analyses that evaluate measurable outcomes like velocity, defect rates, and delivery frequency.

RQ2: What human and organizational factors most significantly influence collaboration and communication in distributed or hybrid software engineering teams?
Scoping: Students can synthesize findings on tools (Slack, GitHub, Jira), team structures, and cross-cultural challenges that are relevant to semester-length project teams.

RQ3: How is artificial intelligence being integrated into developer tools (e.g., code completion, automated testing, bug prediction), and what short-term benefits and challenges have been identified?
Scoping: Students can analyze recent studies and industry reports to evaluate practical implications for productivity and ethical concerns without needing long-term trend analysis.

## Example 2: Course Project: Evaluating AI Tools in Software Engineering

### üéØ Thesis & Research Questions (Scoped to Semester)

**Thesis Statement (scoped):**  
AI tools can meaningfully improve developer productivity in a single course project setting by reducing time on repetitive tasks, improving perceived code quality, and supporting defect detection.  

**Research Questions (scoped):**
1. How much time do students save on routine coding tasks when using AI-powered tools compared to manual coding?  
2. How do students perceive the quality and maintainability of AI-assisted code compared to their own code?  
3. How effective are AI tools at helping students detect bugs in their own assignments/projects?

### üõ†Ô∏è Evaluation Plan

| Research Question | Evaluation Method (feasible for 16 weeks) | Metrics | Data Sources |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| **1. Time saved** | Assign 2‚Äì3 small coding labs (e.g., API wrapper, data parser, unit tests). Half of class uses AI tools, half doesn‚Äôt. Swap roles later. | Avg. task completion time, # of AI-generated lines | GitHub commit timestamps, IDE plugins, self-reports |
| **2. Code quality & cognitive load** | Students submit code samples (with and without AI). Peer review sessions and short NASA-TLX survey on workload. | Code maintainability index, peer ratings, survey scores | Static analysis tools, peer feedback forms |
| **3. Bug detection** | Give students a buggy codebase as a lab. Compare bug reports found with vs. without AI tool support. | # of true positives, # of false positives, severity of bugs found | Bug reports submitted, instructor ‚Äúoracle‚Äù list of seeded bugs |
